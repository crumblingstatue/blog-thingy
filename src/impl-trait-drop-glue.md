# ðŸ¦€ The impl trait drop glue effect ðŸ¦€

Turning a concrete return type into `impl Trait` might have unintended consequences.

To see how, let's create a music player!

```Rust
/// A nice little music player
#[derive(Default)]
struct Player {
    playlist: Playlist,
}

/// A list of music we can choose from
#[derive(Default)]
struct Playlist {
    items: Vec<String>,
}
```

The player has a method to play a song with the provided playlist index.

```Rust
impl Player {
    /// Play a song with the provided playlist index
    fn play(&mut self, _idx: usize) {
        /* Imagine an implementation here */
    }
}
```

So far, so good. As a celebration, let's play the [ðŸ¦€ Crab Rave ðŸ¦€](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM>)!

```Rust
pub fn play_the_crab_rave() {
    let mut player = Player::default();
    if let Some(pos) = player
        .playlist
        .iter()
        .position(|item| item == "crab-rave.mp3")
    {
        player.play(pos);
    }
}
```

The last piece of the puzzle is implementing `Playlist::iter()`.

```Rust
impl Playlist {
    fn iter(&self) -> std::slice::Iter<'_, String> {
        self.items.iter()
    }
}
```

Perfection. Everything compiles as Ferris intended.

...

But let's say I don't wanna promise that the playlist items are stored as a slice.
There is a common solution to this problem, in the form of `impl Trait`.

Let's redefine our function as

```Rust
fn iter(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &'_ String> {
    self.items.iter()
}
```

Now I'm sure everything w-

```Rust
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `player` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> src/lib.rs:27:9
   |
22 |        if let Some(pos) = player
   |   ________________________-
   |  |________________________|
23 | ||         .playlist
   | ||_________________- immutable borrow occurs here
24 | |          .iter()
   | |________________- a temporary with access to the immutable borrow is created here ...
...
27 |            player.play(pos);
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
28 |        }
   |        - ... and the immutable borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the destructor for type `impl Iterator<Item = String>`
```

Oh.

Turns out, by simply returning `impl Iterator`, we lose the information that our returned type does not have drop glue,
and as we can see, drop glue interacts with the borrow checker, breaking our code.

Now the question is, is there a way to encode the existence or lack thereof of drop glue with `impl Trait`?

And if there isn't, should there be?
